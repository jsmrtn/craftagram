# craftagram plugin for Craft CMS 4.x

Grab Instagram content through the Instagram Basic Display API

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.0.0 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require jsmrtn/craftagram

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for craftagram.

## Setting up your Facebook App

> :warning: Important note on step 6 – your valid OAuth Redirect URI **has** to be the URL for the base site, do not try to use individual multi-site URLs. The base site URL will be appended with a state parameter ensuring that the correct site is targeted on the response from Instagram

1. Log in to https://developers.facebook.com, and in _All Apps_ click `Create App`.
2. When asked _What do you want your app to do?_ click `Other`.
3. Select the `Consumer` app type.
4. Add a suitable app name and contact email (you can ignore adding a business portfolio).
5. You will be redirected to your new app, from the dasboard locate the Instagram Basic Display product, and click `Set Up` to add it to your app.
5. Once redirected, click `Create New App`, and name your app whatever you like.
6. When presented with the app page, complete each section using the below:
    - **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** Enter your _Primary Site base URL_, appended with `/actions/craftagram/default/auth` (i.e. https://www.yourwebsite.com/actions/craftagram/default/auth).
    - **Deauthorize Callback URL** and **Data Deletion Request Callback URL** Use the same URL as above.
    - Save Changes
7. Scroll down to the Instagram Testers section. Click `Add Instagram Testers`.
8. Click `Add People`, select `Instagram Tester`, then search for the instagram account you are connecting, then `Add`.
8. Open a new web browser and go to www.instagram.com and sign into your Instagram account that you just invited. Click `More` > `Settings` > `Website Permisisons` > `Apps and websites` > `Tester Invites` and accept the invitation.

That's it! You won't need any extra setup now. What you will need to do is go to Products > Instagram > Basic Display and scroll down to `Instagram App ID` and `Instagram App Secret`, as you'll need to add these in the next step.

## Configuring craftagram

Go to the settings page for `craftagram` and enter your `App ID` and `App Secret` from the step above into the required boxes, and hit 'Save'. When the page refreshes, you'll see there's a new button `Authorise Craft`. Click that button to go to instagram to complete the authorisation procedure.

> Tip: The App ID and App Secret settings can be set to environment variables. See Environmental Configuration in the Craft docs to learn more about that.

Instagram may challenge you with a login screen, so handle that, then click 'Authorize'. You will be redirected back to Craft with the Long Access Token field populated.

> :warning: Check you're logged in to the correct account before you try to authenticate (or don't be logged in at all). If you're logged in with a different user in the current browser session, you're going to have issues.

### Keeping your token active

Instagram tokens expire in 60 days, so you'll need to set up a cron job to keep the token alive. The refresh action is `actions/craftagram/default/refresh-token`.

For example, this would run the token refresh every month, for all enabled sites with tokens

```
0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/wget -q https://www.yourwebsite.com/actions/craftagram/default/refresh-token >/dev/null 2>&1
```

If you just want to update a single site you can add the optional param `siteId`

 ```
 0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/wget -q https://www.yourwebsite.com/actions/craftagram/default/refresh-token?siteId=<your siteId> >/dev/null 2>&1
 ```

If you fail to set up the cron, you can still refresh the token manaully, by going to the settings page, clicking the `Authorise Craft` and following the steps outlined above.

> :warning: You cannot refresh access tokens for private Instagram accounts, so ensure the account used in your tester invite above is public

## Using craftagram

Using the plugin is pretty simple

```
{% set craftagram = craft.craftagram.getInstagramFeed() %}

{% if craftagram|length %}
    {% for item in craftagram.data %}
        <img src={{item.media_url}} />
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

There are two parameters available to the variable, `limit` and `siteId`. The default limit from instagram is 25.

```
{% set craftagram = craft.craftagram.getInstagramFeed(25, currentSite.id) %}
```

| Field Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| limit | The default limit from instagram is 25 |
| siteId | The current site's ID. If you only have one site on your install you can leave this blank, otherwise pass the `siteId` for the site you have added the authorisation to. You can hard-code the site ID if you have only set up authorisation on one of your multi-site installs, otherwise pass the current `siteId` dynamically |

The options that you get are [all of the options](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/reference/media#fields) provided from the API endpoint. For brevity, they are:

| Field Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| caption | The Media's caption text. Not returnable for Media in albums. |
| id | The Media's ID. |
| media_type | The Media's type. Can be IMAGE, VIDEO, or CAROUSEL_ALBUM. |
| media_url | The Media's URL. |
| permalink | The Media's permanent URL. |
| thumbnail_url | The Media's thumbnail image URL. Only available on VIDEO Media. |
| timestamp | The Media's publish date in ISO 8601 format. |
| username | The Media owner's username. |

### Pagination

If you have limits on your feed, you can pass the `after` (or `before` if you're paginating backwards) parameter and init an AJAX function to return the data.

Remember to pass `limit`, and also to pass the correct `siteId` for the active site, if appropriate.

For example, you could do this to have a 'load more' button:
```
{% set craftagram = craft.craftagram.getInstagramFeed(10) %}

{% if craftagram|length %}
    <div data-js="insta-wrapper">
        {% for item in craftagram.data %}
            <img src={{item.media_url}} />
        {% endfor %}
    </div>

    <a data-after="{{ craftagram.paging.cursors.after }}" data-js="load-more">Load more</a>
{% endif %}

{% js %}
    $("[data-js=load-more]").click(function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        $.get("{{ parseEnv(craft.app.sites.primarySite.baseUrl) }}/actions/craftagram/default/get-next-page?siteId={{ currentSite.id }}&limit=10&url=" + $(this).data('after'), function(res) {
            data = $.parseJSON(res);

            // For each, append the item to our wrapper
            $.each(data["data"], function() {
                $("[data-js='insta-wrapper']").append("<img src="+$(this)[0]["media_url"]+" />");
            });

            // Update the paging with the next after.
            $("[data-js=load-more]").data("after", data["paging"]["cursors"]["after"]);
        });
    });
{% endjs %}
```

### Headless mode

If you're using Craft headless (or generally just need a JSON formatted version of your results), you can access the instagram feed via `/actions/craftagram/default/api` (or `/craftagramApi` if you want to save some bytes), which will return the raw JSON data from instagram. You can pass the following parameters:

| URL Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| limit | The default limit from instagram is 25 |
| siteId | The current site's ID. If you only have one site on your install you can leave this blank, otherwise pass the `siteId` for the site you have added the authorisation to. You can hard-code the site ID if you have only set up authorisation on one of your multi-site installs, otherwise pass the current `siteId` dynamically |
| url | Pass the `after` or `before` parameters from `data->paging->cursors` to get the next or the previous set of results |

#### Security

There is a setting to opt-in to a more secure API endpoint. If you switch it on, you must pass a `Basic Auth` header to access this endpoint, otherwise you will receive an error. The Username and Password should be for an activated Craft user. **Please note** that you must enable the secure endpoint for each site individually.

### Rate Limits

Be conscious you might be subject to rate limits from instagram, so if you're on a high traffic website you might get rate limited. You can read more about rate limits at instagram's [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/rate-limiting#instagram). 

### Media Size

The image returned from the API is an immutable size–it used to be you could use modifiers like `large` to get an image at a certain size, but no more. You will need to use a plugin that supports transforming images from remote URL's to resize the images returned from Instagram.
